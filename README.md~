What is Quidwallet?
----------------

Quidwallet is an experimental digital currency wallet that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world based on CRYPTONOTE. Quidwallet uses peer-to-peer 
technology created by Quid Core software to operate and to confirm any type 
of transaction done on the network and through the network worldwaide
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Quid Core wallet is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.


## BUILDING ON UNIX/WINDOWS 

**1. Clone wallet sources**

```
git clone https://github.com/cryptonotefoundation/cryptonotewallet.git
```

**2. Modify `QuidWallet.cmake`**
 
```
set(CN_PROJECT_NAME "furiouscoin")
set(CN_CURRENCY_DISPLAY_NAME "FuriousCoin")
set(CN_CURRENCY_TICKER "XFC")
```

**3. Set symbolic link to coin sources at the same level as `src`. For example:**

```
ln -s ../cryptonote cryptonote
```

Alternative way is to create git submodule:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/cryptonotefoundation/cryptonote.git cryptonote
```

Replace URL with git remote repository of your coin.

**4. Build**

```
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make
```
